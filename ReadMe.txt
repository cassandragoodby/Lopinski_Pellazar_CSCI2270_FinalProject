Our final project will be storing the statistics of different PAC-12 basketball players.

We will be using a hash table to store all of the information on the players.
A binary search tree is also an option that will be considered for the project.

The statistics will be read in from a file at the start of the program.
Along with including find, insert, and delete functions, a function will also be included to update the statistics of players
by reading in a new file with information from the last/most recent game that was played.

A linked list will also be created to separate the different teams in order to have a faster search.
